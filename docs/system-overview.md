# System Overview

## The runtime pieces

| Component       | Role                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Server**      | Central hub. Stores all state in a SQLite database, exposes an HTTP API, and pushes change notifications over WebSocket. Stateless itself; the DB is the source of truth. Routes work to hosts over the active daemon WebSocket.                                                                                |
| **Host daemon** | Runs on each enrolled execution machine. Connects to the server, handles host RPC requests, provisions workspaces, runs agent provider processes, and posts events back. Exposes a local HTTP API for co-located app and CLI operations such as opening an editor, picking folders, and checking daemon status. |
| **App**         | Web UI for inspecting projects and threads, following progress, and steering work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **CLI** (`bb`)  | First-class interface for both users and agents. Same capabilities as the app, scriptable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Data model

The core entities and how they relate:

**Project**: the top-level container, usually mapped to a repository. A project has one or more **sources** that say where its code lives. Each local-path source belongs to a specific enrolled host, so one project can map to paths on multiple machines.

**Thread**: the unit of work. Each thread tracks a conversation with an agent provider, has lifecycle state, and produces an append-only stream of **events** (messages, tool calls, file changes, etc.). Threads can be **standard** (does work directly) or **manager** (coordinates other threads). Threads can own child threads for delegation.

**Environment**: the execution context for a thread. It binds a workspace (a directory on disk) to a host. An environment can be **unmanaged** (point at an existing directory), or **managed**. Environments managed by bb will be cleaned up when there are no longer any unarchived threads using it. Multiple threads can share an environment.

**Host**: a long-lived daemon identity for a machine that runs work. A server has a primary host and can enroll additional remote hosts; project sources and environments retain the host boundary.

**Commands and events**: the server talks to daemons over the active daemon WebSocket with host RPC requests. Lifecycle work such as provisioning an environment, starting a thread, or stopping a thread can run asynchronously from the API caller's perspective, and the server settles command side effects when the daemon returns an RPC result. Daemons separately post provider and thread progress as event batches.

**Session Fabric**: the provider-native control layer for discovering external
conversations, binding exact live runtime incarnations, auditing model changes,
and continuing work across providers. The server owns the durable lineage and
command ledger; the host daemon's Runtime Broker owns local fencing and
workspace mutation authority. Broker fences and recovery receipts survive
daemon restarts, and an ordinary idle send recovers only after proving the exact
recorded runtime is dead and its binding evidence is unchanged. The typed SDK
exposes the full workflow; core `bb session` commands retain guarded mutations,
while the optional official plugin provides `bb fabric` connection and audit
commands. See
[Session Fabric](./session-fabric.md).

## Contracts and boundaries

Two contract packages define the boundaries between components:

**`@bb/server-contract`**: the HTTP + WebSocket API between clients (app, CLI) and the server. Route schemas, request/response types, WebSocket notification types.

**`@bb/host-daemon-contract`**: the protocol between the server and host daemons. Command types, event types, session lifecycle, the local API for app/CLI.

Implementation packages never import across these boundaries. The server doesn't know how workspaces are provisioned. The daemon doesn't know about threads or projects beyond what commands tell it.
